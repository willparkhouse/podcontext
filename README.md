Download Spotify and YouTube transcripts for LLM context.

A Chrome extension that adds a download button to Spotify podcast episodes and YouTube video transcripts, saving them as plain text files perfect for use with ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs.

## Usage

### Spotify Podcasts

## Output Formats

## Troubleshooting

### Spotify

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Auth tokens not captured" | Interact with the Spotify page (play/pause, click around) then try again |
| "No transcript available" | Not all episodes have transcripts - check if Spotify shows a "Transcript" button |
| Button not appearing | Make sure you're on an episode page (URL contains `/episode/`) |

### YouTube

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Button not appearing | Make sure you've opened YouTube's transcript panel first (click "...more" → "Show transcript") |
| "No transcript segments found" | The transcript may still be loading - wait a moment and try again |
| No "Show transcript" option | The video doesn't have captions/transcripts available |

## How It Works

### Spotify
The extension intercepts Spotify's authentication tokens from network requests, then uses them to fetch transcripts from Spotify's internal API. Before downloading, you can rename the generic speaker labels to actual names.

### YouTube
The extension watches for YouTube's transcript panel to open. Once you click "Show transcript" on a video, a download button appears in the transcript panel. Clicking it extracts the transcript text directly from the page - no API calls needed, so it works reliably with any video that has captions.
